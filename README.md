huffman-compression
===================

	This is a sofware to compress the files or decompress files. All this I did in Linux OS, that is to say that
some system call can't use in other OS. To use it, you'd better compile it in Linux and run in Linux.
	The basic alogrithm is binary tree and bit operations. But the most basic is system calls like read, write
and file functions.
	As a compress software, the compress rate is most important. But here, we just want to know how to make a 
compress software. All the compress softwares' gola is same that is compress the data into a small scale.
